    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pasta Bake with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil</p>
    <p>
      My whole family loves it, and there is not much prep. Once the pasta bake
      is in the oven, you can make a salad or set the table, and then it's time
      to eat.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>

        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook,
